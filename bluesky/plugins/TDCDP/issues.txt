1. Vehicles overshoot second waypoint when this is an operation waypoint. Cause unknown
2. Truck doesnt go to WP when its a back and forth route. E.G. TRUCK469. Caused by iactwp incrementing before location is reached.
3. Accuracy of reaching destination is quite low. Could be fixed. sometimes overshoots with couple of meters.

5. Drone activity: Multiple drones can be 'active' i.e. stored in the memory, while not in the simulation. This causes higher number drones to be active as well, while there is only 1 drone.
6. Drones do not get deleted at end depot node because truck is deleted first.
7. When running the code twice, variables are not reset (like self.dronemanager)
8. Operational durations are not a variable yet for Rendezvous and drone delivery
